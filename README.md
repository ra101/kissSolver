It was being developed with the help of:

- tf.js and opencv.js

- OpenCV dev tools

- commandline use tensorflowjs 

- python implementation of os-library, numpy, opencv and keras
<p align='right'>keras or tensorflowjs <i>might</i> not be required</p>

## F.A.Q. regarding development:



### Problem Statement?

Self-Explanatory!

![kissanime.ru/Special/AreYouHuman2?reUrl=](./assets/problemStatement.png)

<br>

### How are images segregated?

There are 2 ways 

- Subtract pixel values from problem image given to generic image (image without number) [slow but accurate]
- Check for similar dimensions (images can have similar dimensions) [fast but inaccurate]

<br>

### What kind of A.I. is used?

1. **Haar Cascade**: *for finding out where is the number is in image* (ML)
2. **Convolutional Neural Network**: *for finding out what that number is* (DL)
